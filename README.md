Visual Scripting

Students will master Unreal’s Blueprint system to create functional game mechanics while blending design and programming principles. They will explore AI-enhanced workflows to prototype and refine mechanics, leveraging procedural systems and generative AI for system design ideas and variations. Optional C++ modules are available for students who want to deepen their technical skills and explore more advanced programming concepts.

3DArt

Building on skills from 3D Art I, students will learn digital sculpting, look development, and rigging while refining their 3D modeling and creating character and environment assets. They will develop materials, enhance rendering techniques, and integrate assets into game engines using industry-standard texturing workflows, with AI tools assisting in concept exploration and refinement. Students will create a complete 3D scene for their final project, combining assets from Term 1 and Term 2 to showcase their skills.

Programming

Building on Game Programming 1, students will develop advanced Unity and C# skills while integrating visual scripting as a supplementary tool. They will learn to implement complex game mechanics for genres such as 2D and 3D platformers and strategy games, focusing on physics, AI behaviors, and gameplay systems. AI-assisted tools support debugging, code optimization, and prototyping, helping students refine technical problem-solving and development workflows.

Writing

This course explores narrative design principles for games, focusing on interactive storytelling and collaborative tabletop RPG games. Students will examine the history of games while writing their own branching narrative stories and games, using AI-driven tools to generate and refine dialogue and characters. Throughout the course, they will develop engaging, player-driven narratives that respond to choice and interaction.
